            <h2>Meet Grandad</h2>
            <p><b>K</b>ennth Vancil, known to his family (as well as you!) as Grandad, was the hard-working but soft-mannered man
                responsible for bringing your meal before you. Growing up on a farm, Grandad picked up many different recipes from
                his mother and father for lots of nice and hearty country meals. <br><br>
                Once he got older, Grandad made these meals for his wife, his children, and inevitably, his grandchildren and extended family.
                His grandkids would excitedly gobble down his chicken and dumplings and biscuits and gravy, both their stomachs and their hearts full.
                Now, with the help of Chef Cookie Cutter, Grandad's legacy can live on in a restaraunt that serves family meals, both from him and others.

                <h2>Carrying on the Legacy</h2>
                <p><b>O</b>ur mission at Grandad's is to bring that warm, homemade feeling to you the same way Grandad did: with hot, 
                    fresh meals and a smile.<br><br>
                    To keep Grandad's feeling small and friendly, we plan to keep our brick-and-mortar restaraunt as-is; No expanding,
                    no franchising, just us, you, and a bowl of Chicken n' Dumplin's.
