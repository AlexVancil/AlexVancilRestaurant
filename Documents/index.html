    Any code not taught in this class was either learned in my previous web design class or learned through MDN web docs. 
    I did not take anyone else's code from the internet, but would look up if certain things were possible in CSS, then used that knowledge to write my own code. -->

    <!-- I tried to go all out in this project by making it pretty dynamic to avoid it becoming boring. I discovered and implemented the 
    "z-index" property, which, when used with different "position" properties, allow items to be overlapped in ways that aren't possible
    by just using usual divs.
    I added a few SEO tactics such as using a relevent title for the website in the head so that it catches the attention of people looking for restaurants.
    I also made sure to include "alt" text on images so that the website is seen as reader-friendly and hopefully gets more clicks.
    Finally, I tried to keep the retention time somewhat high by making the logo the first thing that people see, then when it shrinks
    they see the rest of the site and get curious. -->
